    External API: dialogflow and watson assistant 
        Bot1(dialogflow):       https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/editAgent/f3fb739e-dd8a-4569-89e6-ced21c392a87/
        Bot2(dialogflow):       https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/editAgent/008c0a5c-6663-437a-bf0b-f74051a5eb93/
        Bot3(watson assistant): https://assistant-us-east.watsonplatform.net/us-east/crn:v1:bluemix:public:conversation:us-east:a~2F525a1bcc48ea4759ab60ac566b4281a0:530671d6-b175-46e2-997d-24b835f9577b::/assistants

--Principle of the project
  1. If you run project, go to views/homepage.ejs  32 line ~ 49 line is part that receive data from db when you hit url with get mode (http://localhost:3000/) 
     backend: see app.js 37 line ~ 53 line
     
  2. Drag and drop
    when you drag and drop bots to question and answer, call getintents() function automatically after 10s  (you can see 74 line ~ 82 line in public/javascripts/main.js)
  3. when click start button, call getintent() function in manually
    if the bot to answer is watson assistant , call intentMessages_wa() function or :dialogflow , call intentMessages_dia() function.

    1) intentMessages_wa()  (241 line ~ 261 line) 
     In here you can get intent of conversation using ajax from node backend (app.js  : 53 line ~ 89 line)
     In backend call watson assistant to get intent using infor(api, url, workspaceid,...) from db.
     In frontend, after get intent, call startfunc_wa(intents) : 193 line ~ 204 line of public/javascripts/main.js.
     You can get message for question per every intent (questionMessage_wa(intent) : 296 ~ 331 line) and call answerMessage() : 409 line ~ 449 line.
     In backend (app.js) call watson assistant api to get question and answer like get intent (question message : 91 line ~ 129 line , answer message : 130 line ~ 164 line)
     so, question message and answer message are added in right panel step by step 
     
             *** call wait() function to delay time ***
    
    2)intentMessages_dia() (260 line ~ 294 line) -> to get intent you can see app.js 166 ~ 180
     In this function call external api directly to get intent.
     if success, call  startfunc_dia()
     in here, use array of intent like intentMessages_dia()

  4. When click stop button. call stop_conversation()  

  5. when click save button, call save_conversation() and save db/chatting.json and so click download button and download data.json


  6. Disadvantage of connector
    It doesn't mean for multichat because 
     if project have 3 bots have different intent, to chat each other every bot have a lot of data : include 3 intents
     The 3 different bots doesn't recognize intent, so chatting will stop and have not generally.
